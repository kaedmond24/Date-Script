Created By Kevin Edmond

Repository for Date Script: Interactive python script that simulates a two poeple going on a date.

### Instructions:

1. Run the script by using the command: `python3 date.py`

### Script Logic:

1.  Prompt for names of people on the date.

    > ```
    > Your Name:
    > Date's Name:
    > ```
    >
    > <br>

2.  Prompt for starting budget:

    > ```
    > Enter Budget:
    > ```
    >
    > <br>

3.  Prompt for a restaurant level and set order total to 0. The restaurant level is representative of a star level.

    > ```
    > Select Restauant Level [1, 2, or 3]:
    > ```
    >
    > <br>

4.  Prompt user for menu and drink selections.

    > ```
    > Your Menu Order:
    > Date's Menu Order:
    >
    > Your Drink Order:
    > Date's Drink Order:
    > ```
    >
    > <br>

5.  Output details of the date. Show the order total and the remaining budget minus
    the order total.

    > ```
    > Your total bill will be $order_total!
    >
    > Hi $my_name, you have $budget in your account.
    > ```
    >
    > <br>

6.  Based on the remaining budget, a conditional statement is used to determine the status of a second date. The output of
    of the statement implies whether another date would take place.
